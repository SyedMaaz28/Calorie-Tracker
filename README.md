# Calorie Tracker using GenAI with Gemini Models

# Overview

  This project is a Calorie Tracker powered by Generative AI technology, utilizing Gemini models. The tracker is designed to simplify the process of monitoring food intake by allowing users to take a photo of their meal. The tool then analyzes the image and provides detailed nutritional information, including calorie count, macronutrient breakdown, and other dietary insights based on the input prompt.

# Features

• Image-Based Food Recognition: Users can take a photo of their food, and the tool will recognize and identify the food items present.

• Calorie Estimation: Provides an accurate estimation of the calories in the meal based on the recognized food items.

• Nutritional Breakdown: Offers a detailed breakdown of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) and other nutritional components.

• Customizable Prompts: Users can input specific prompts or questions (e.g., "How many carbs are in this meal?") to receive tailored responses.

• User-friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity in mind, the interface makes it easy to upload photos and receive nutritional information quickly.

# Technology Stack

• GenAI: Powers the intelligent analysis of food images and the generation of detailed nutritional responses.

• Gemini Models: Applied for high-accuracy food recognition and nutritional estimation, ensuring reliable outcomes.

• Python Programming Language: The primary language used to develop the application.

• Some Important Libraries like Streamlit , dotenv etc
